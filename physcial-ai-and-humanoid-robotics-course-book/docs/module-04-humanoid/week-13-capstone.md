# Week 13: Capstone Project

## Overview

The capstone project is your opportunity to integrate all concepts from the 13-week curriculum into a comprehensive, real-world robotics scenario. You'll design, simulate, and analyze a humanoid robot system.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Integrate all learned concepts in a comprehensive project
- Design and simulate a humanoid robot system
- Present and evaluate your solution

## Project Options

Choose one of the following scenarios:

### Option 1: Object Manipulation

**Scenario**: Humanoid robot picks up objects from a shelf and places them in a bin.

**Requirements**:
- Design URDF model with arm and gripper
- Implement grasping logic using inverse kinematics
- Create world with objects in Gazebo/Isaac Sim
- Test robustness to object variations

**Deliverables**:
- URDF file
- ROS 2 pick-and-place node
- Simulation demo video
- Project report

### Option 2: Navigation and Exploration

**Scenario**: Humanoid robot navigates an unknown indoor environment.

**Requirements**:
- Implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- Use LIDAR for obstacle detection
- Create navigation pipeline
- Test in complex environments

**Deliverables**:
- Navigation stack integration
- Map generation results
- Autonomous traversal demo
- Analysis of path efficiency

### Option 3: Locomotion Optimization

**Scenario**: Optimize bipedal gait for energy efficiency.

**Requirements**:
- Design humanoid with articulated legs
- Implement gait controller
- Measure energy consumption (simulated)
- Optimize parameters using RL or search

**Deliverables**:
- Gait controller code
- Energy consumption metrics
- Optimization results
- Comparison report

## Project Deliverables

All projects should include:

1. **Code**: Well-documented, runnable ROS 2 nodes
2. **Simulation**: Functional Gazebo/Isaac Sim worlds
3. **Report**: Technical documentation (PDF, 5-10 pages)
4. **Demo Video**: Under 2 minute recording of working system
5. **Presentation**: Live demo and Q&A

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Completeness**: All requirements met
- **Technical Quality**: Code is clean, efficient, robust
- **Innovation**: Goes beyond basic requirements
- **Documentation**: Clear explanations and results
- **Presentation**: Effective communication of results

## Conclusion

Congratulations on completing this 13-week curriculum! You now have the foundational knowledge and practical skills to work with humanoid robots and embodied AI systems. Continue learning through research papers, open-source projects, and hands-on robotics competitions.
