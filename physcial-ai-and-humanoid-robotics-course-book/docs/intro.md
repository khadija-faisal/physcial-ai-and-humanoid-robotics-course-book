# Getting Started with Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Learning Platform! This is a comprehensive 13-week curriculum designed to take you from foundational concepts in embodied intelligence through advanced topics in humanoid robotics, ROS 2, and vision-language action (VLA) systems.

## About This Curriculum

This textbook covers:

- **Week 1-2**: Physical AI foundations and sensors (LIDAR, IMU)
- **Week 3-5**: ROS 2 fundamentals, nodes, and topics
- **Week 6-10**: Gazebo physics simulation and NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- **Week 11-13**: Humanoid locomotion and capstone projects

## Learning Path

Start with **Module 1: Foundations** to understand embodied intelligence and sensor systems, then progress through ROS 2, simulation, and finally humanoid robotics.
