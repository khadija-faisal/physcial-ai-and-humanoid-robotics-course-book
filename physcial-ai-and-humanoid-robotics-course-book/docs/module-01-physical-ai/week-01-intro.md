# Week 1: Intro to Embodied Intelligence

## Overview

This chapter introduces the concept of embodied intelligence—the idea that understanding emerges from interaction with the physical world. You'll learn why physical robotics matters and how sensors enable robots to perceive their environment.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Understand the fundamentals of embodied AI and physical intelligence
- Recognize the role of sensors in robotic systems
- Learn basic physics principles relevant to robotics

## What is Embodied Intelligence?

Embodied intelligence refers to cognitive processes that are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the world. Unlike traditional AI, which relies purely on computation, embodied AI combines perception, action, and physical presence.

### Key Concepts

1. **Perception**: Robots sense their environment through sensors (cameras, LIDAR, IMU)
2. **Cognition**: The robot processes this sensory data to understand and decide
3. **Action**: The robot acts in the world based on its decisions
4. **Learning**: The robot learns from the feedback loop of sense-think-act

## Why Physical Robotics?

Physical robots differ from simulations because they:
- Must deal with real-world uncertainties and noise
- Have physical constraints (power, size, speed)
- Can interact with humans and physical objects
- Learn through embodied experience

## Next Steps

Proceed to Week 2 for an introduction to sensor systems and data acquisition.
